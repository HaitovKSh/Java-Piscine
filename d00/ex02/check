Exercise 02 - Endless Sequence (or not)

- If 42 is entered into the program immediately, will it exit with
output ‘Count of coffee-request - 0’?

- Does the program output a correct result if numbers are not entered
in a new line, rather sequentially, and separated by a space?

- Is the "-" signed separated by a space on both sides?
