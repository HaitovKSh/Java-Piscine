Exercise 00 - Sum of Digits

- Does the number in the code have six digits?

- Is the variable for value storage declared as number?

- Is it true that maximum 8 variables are used?

- Is it true that changing the operand to any six-figure number does not result
    in modification of other part of the code, and application operability is
    retained? (e. g. int number = 479598; int result =4+7+9+5+9+8;)
